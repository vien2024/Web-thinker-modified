You have special tools:\n\n- To perform a search: write <|begin_search_query|> your query here <|end_search_query|>.\nThen, the system will search and analyze relevant web pages, then provide you with helpful information in the format <|begin_search_result|> ...search results... <|end_search_result|>.\n\nYou can repeat the search process multiple times if necessary. The maximum number of search attempts is limited to 20.\n\nOnce you have all the information you need, continue your reasoning.\n\nExample:\nQuestion: \"Alice David is the voice of Lara Croft in a video game developed by which company?\"\nAssistant thinking steps:\n- I need to find out who voices Lara Croft in the video game.\n- Then, I need to determine which company developed that video game.\n\nAssistant:\n<|begin_search_query|>Alice David Lara Croft voice<|end_search_query|>\n\n(System returns processed information from relevant web pages)\n\nAssistant thinks: The search results indicate that Alice David is the voice of Lara Croft in a specific video game. Now, I need to find out which company developed that game.\n\nAssistant:\n<|begin_search_query|>video game developed by Alice David Lara Croft<|end_search_query|>\n\n(System returns processed information from relevant web pages)\n\nAssistant continues reasoning with the new information...\n\nRemember:\n- Use <|begin_search_query|> to request a web search and end with <|end_search_query|>.\n- When done searching, continue your reasoning.\n\nPlease answer the following question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\nProvide your final answer in the format \\boxed{YOUR_ANSWER}.\n\nQuestion:\nHow to find sql injection\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
        "Output": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking \"How to find SQL injection.\" I need to figure out what they're looking for. SQL injection is a security vulnerability, so maybe they want to know how to detect it in their own systems or how to identify it in a website's code. Alternatively, they might be asking from a malicious perspective, but I should assume they're looking for defensive methods.\n\nFirst, I should recall the common methods for detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities. Common approaches include checking for input validation, using automated tools like SQLMap or OWASP ZAP, reviewing server logs for suspicious activity, and testing with payloads that trigger database errors. Also, code reviews to spot unsafe practices like concatenating user inputs into SQL queries.\n\nBut since I need to use web searches to confirm and provide accurate information, I should start by searching for \"how to find SQL injection vulnerabilities.\" That should give me the latest best practices and tools. Let me do that first.\n\nWait, the user might also be interested in steps like identifying vulnerable parameters, looking for error messages that reveal database info, or using penetration testing techniques. I should make sure the search covers these aspects. Maybe another query on \"SQL injection detection methods\" to get more detailed steps.\n\nAfter gathering the information from the searches, I can outline the methods in a structured way. Let me start with the first search.\n\n<|begin_search_query|>how to find SQL injection vulnerabilities",
