You have special tools:\n\n- To perform a search: write <|begin_search_query|> your query here <|end_search_query|>.\nThen, the system will search and analyze relevant web pages, then provide you with helpful information in the format <|begin_search_result|> ...search results... <|end_search_result|>.\n\nYou can repeat the search process multiple times if necessary. The maximum number of search attempts is limited to 20.\n\nOnce you have all the information you need, continue your reasoning.\n\nExample:\nQuestion: \"Alice David is the voice of Lara Croft in a video game developed by which company?\"\nAssistant thinking steps:\n- I need to find out who voices Lara Croft in the video game.\n- Then, I need to determine which company developed that video game.\n\nAssistant:\n<|begin_search_query|>Alice David Lara Croft voice<|end_search_query|>\n\n(System returns processed information from relevant web pages)\n\nAssistant thinks: The search results indicate that Alice David is the voice of Lara Croft in a specific video game. Now, I need to find out which company developed that game.\n\nAssistant:\n<|begin_search_query|>video game developed by Alice David Lara Croft<|end_search_query|>\n\n(System returns processed information from relevant web pages)\n\nAssistant continues reasoning with the new information...\n\nRemember:\n- Use <|begin_search_query|> to request a web search and end with <|end_search_query|>.\n- When done searching, continue your reasoning.\n\nPlease answer the following question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\nProvide your final answer in the format \\boxed{YOUR_ANSWER}.\n\nQuestion:\nHow to find sql injection\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
        "Output": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking \"How to find SQL injection.\" Let me break this down. First, I need to understand what they're looking for. SQL injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate SQL queries through user input. So, the user probably wants to know methods to detect or identify SQL injection vulnerabilities in their own code or in a system they're testing.\n\nI should start by recalling common techniques for finding SQL injection points. One approach is to look for user input fields that interact with a database, like login forms, search bars, etc. Then, testing those inputs with malicious payloads to see if the application is vulnerable. But maybe the user wants a more structured answer, including tools or manual methods.\n\nI might need to use the web search tool to get the most up-to-date information. Let me think of the best search query. The user is asking how to find it, so maybe \"methods to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities\" or \"tools for finding SQL injection.\" Let me try the first one.\n\nFirst search query: \"How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities.\" That should cover manual testing steps and automated tools. After getting the results, I can look for common practices like input validation, error messages, using SQL maps, or tools like SQLMap, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite. Also, maybe mention checking for dynamic queries in code, like in PHP, Python, or other languages where SQL is concatenated with user input.\n\nWait, the user might also be interested in the process of identifying these vulnerabilities, such as injecting test strings and observing the response. For example, adding a single quote to a form field and seeing if the application returns a database error. Or using UNION SELECT statements to test for data retrieval.\n\nI should also consider explaining the steps in order: first, identifying input points, then testing them with various payloads, analyzing responses, and using tools for automation. Maybe also touch on code review practices, like looking for unsafe functions (e.g., mysql_query in PHP, or not using parameterized queries in other languages).\n\nAnother thing: the user might be a developer looking to secure their application, or a security professional doing penetration testing. The answer should cover both manual and automated approaches. Also, mention best practices for preventing SQL injection once found, but the main focus is on detection.\n\nI need to make sure the information is accurate. Let me perform the search to confirm the current methods and tools. Let's proceed with the first search query.\n\n<|begin_search_query|>How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities",
