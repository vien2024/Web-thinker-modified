You have special tools:\n\n- To perform a search: write <|begin_search_query|> your query here <|end_search_query|>. It must end in <|end_search_query|>\nThen, the system will search and analyze relevant web pages, then provide you with helpful information in the format <|begin_search_result|> ...search results... <|end_search_result|>.\n\nYou can repeat the search process multiple times if necessary. The maximum number of search attempts is limited to 20.\n\nOnce you have all the information you need, continue your reasoning.\n\nExample:\nQuestion: \"Alice David is the voice of Lara Croft in a video game developed by which company?\"\nAssistant thinking steps:\n- I need to find out who voices Lara Croft in the video game.\n- Then, I need to determine which company developed that video game.\n\nAssistant:\n<|begin_search_query|>Alice David Lara Croft voice<|end_search_query|>\n\n(System returns processed information from relevant web pages)\n\nAssistant thinks: The search results indicate that Alice David is the voice of Lara Croft in a specific video game. Now, I need to find out which company developed that game.\n\nAssistant:\n<|begin_search_query|>video game developed by Alice David Lara Croft<|end_search_query|>\n\n(System returns processed information from relevant web pages)\n\nAssistant continues reasoning with the new information...\n\nRemember:\n- Use <|begin_search_query|> to request a web search and end with <|end_search_query|>.\n- When done searching, continue your reasoning.\n\nPlease answer the following question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\nProvide your final answer in the format \\boxed{YOUR_ANSWER}.\n\nQuestion:\nHow to find sql injection\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
        "Output": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking \"How to find SQL injection.\" I need to figure out what they're looking for. Are they trying to find if a website is vulnerable to SQL injection, or are they looking for ways to detect SQL injection attacks in their own systems? Probably the former, since it's a common security concern.\n\nFirst, I should outline the general steps for testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities. But I should also mention the importance of ethical considerations and legal permissions. You don't want to suggest doing this without authorization.\n\nCommon methods include checking for error messages when inputting malicious strings, using tools like SQLMap, or automated scanners. Maybe also manual testing with single quotes to see if the site crashes or returns an error. For example, entering a single quote in a login field and seeing if it triggers a database error.\n\nI should also think about different types of SQL injection, like in-band, inferential, and out-of-band. Each has different detection methods. Maybe mention looking for suspicious parameters in URLs, forms, or cookies. Testing for boolean-based or time-based blind SQLi by observing response times or content changes.\n\nNeed to verify if these steps are accurate. Let me do a web search to confirm the standard techniques. \n\n<|begin_search_query|>methods to find SQL injection vulnerabilities",
