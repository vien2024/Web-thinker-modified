You have special tools:\n\n- To perform a search: write <|begin_search_query|> your query here <|end_search_query|>.\nThen, the system will search and analyze relevant web pages, then provide you with helpful information in the format <|begin_search_result|> ...search results... <|end_search_result|>.\n\nYou can repeat the search process multiple times if necessary. The maximum number of search attempts is limited to 20.\n\nOnce you have all the information you need, continue your reasoning.\n\nExample:\nQuestion: \"Alice David is the voice of Lara Croft in a video game developed by which company?\"\nAssistant thinking steps:\n- I need to find out who voices Lara Croft in the video game.\n- Then, I need to determine which company developed that video game.\n\nAssistant:\n<|begin_search_query|>Alice David Lara Croft voice<|end_search_query|>\n\n(System returns processed information from relevant web pages)\n\nAssistant thinks: The search results indicate that Alice David is the voice of Lara Croft in a specific video game.

        "Output": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking \"How to find SQL injection.\" I need to figure out what they're looking for. SQL injection is a security vulnerability, so maybe they want to know how to detect it in a system or how to identify if a website is vulnerable. Alternatively, they might be asking for methods to test for SQL injection, like tools or techniques.\n\nFirst, I should clarify the different angles. If they're a developer, they might want to know how to find and fix SQL injection vulnerabilities in their code. If they're a security researcher or penetration tester, they might be looking for ways to test for SQL injection in web applications. Or perhaps they're trying to understand the signs that indicate an SQL injection attack is happening.\n\nSince the question is a bit open-ended, I'll start by explaining what SQL injection is briefly. Then outline common methods to detect it. Common techniques include checking for input validation issues, using automated tools like SQLMap or OWASP ZAP, reviewing server logs for suspicious activity, and performing manual testing by entering malicious payloads into input fields.\n\nI should also mention best practices for preventing SQL injection, as detection is part of a broader security strategy. Maybe the user is looking for both detection and prevention. Let me verify if there are standard steps or tools recommended for this. I'll do a web search to get the most up-to-date information on detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\nThe search query should be something like \"how to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities.\" Let me check the results. The search results might include articles, tutorials, or official documentation from security organizations. From there, I can gather steps like using prepared statements, input validation, error handling, and security testing tools.\n\nWait, but the user specifically asked \"how to find,\" not necessarily how to prevent. So the focus should be on detection methods. The search results might list manual testing techniques, automated scanning tools, and code review practices. I should also consider mentioning looking for error messages that reveal database structure, which is a sign of potential vulnerabilities.\n\nAnother point is to test different input vectors: forms, URL parameters, cookies, etc. Using tools like SQLMap can automatically detect and exploit SQL injection flaws. Also, penetration testing frameworks or methods might be involved. Let me structure the answer step by step, starting from manual methods to automated tools, and then to monitoring and logs.\n\n<|begin_search_query|>how to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities",
